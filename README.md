# README

This repository contains my master thesis at [EPFL Institute of Physics](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/iphys/). The thesis title goes by **Page Curve of Holographic Interfaces**. The main paper can be found in the .pdf file.

### Abstract
>This note aims to study the Page curve of a gravitational system featuring a wall separating twogeometries. This system was found by taking the limit of large degrees of freedom in one sliceof the dual geometry of an ICFT sitting in its spacetime boundary to model something close toa black hole and taking the limit of large boundary in the other slice. The dominant phase inthis limit is found to be a bulk solution with a horizon on each side with the wall penetrating it.RT surfaces were computed in the single sided geometry. We then purify our system by meansof the double sided geometry, dual to the thermofield double state. We present 3 dimensionalPenrose diagrams of the dominant phase. We then argue that there are two possible RT surfaces.We show that one of them is an increasing function of time, with the growth becoming linear fortimes larger than the inverse of the temperature. The other RT surface is constant representingthe saturation at late time. The overall entropy follows a Page curve.


### Directories
This GitHub repository contains 3 folders:
  * Latex: contains the complete report (.pdf & .tex)
  * Matlab: contains matlab script for the plots presented in the report
  * Mathematica: contains Mathematica script used for some computations in the report
 
 In both, Matlab and Mathematica scripts, you can change the values of the parameters at the begining of the code.
